    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p><em>When you think "1970s Party" you think fondue. Still, it defies logic that a pot full of melted cheese has been out of fashion for over 40 years. In these Instagram-obsessed times, could there possibly be something more attractive than putting a pot of sexy cheese in a room full of sexy people? Absolutely not. Call your friends over immediately, because it's time to get your #cheesevibes on.</em></p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <strong><ul class = "list">
        <li>2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Gruyere</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Swiss cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups Sauvignon Blanc, or any other dry white wine</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon malt vinegar</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li></strong>
        <li>Serving suggestions: sliced apples and pears, roasted potatoes and bread chunks</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol class="list">
        <li>Place the Cheddar, Gruyere and Swiss cheeses into a large zip-top bag along with the flour. Shake well to coat.</li><br>
        <li>Bring the Sauvignon Blanc to a boil in a large saucepan, then reduce to a simmer. Whisk in the cheese 1/2 cup at a time, making sure the cheese melts before each addition. Add the butter and malt vinegar, then reduce the heat to the lowest possible setting to keep warm. </li><br>
        <li>Using a chef knife, microplane zester or handheld press, crush the garlic into a paste, reserving the juices. Rub all over the inside of a fondue pot to coat well. If there is any excess garlic paste, toss it into the saucepan and whisk it in. </li><br>
        <li>Pour the fondue into the prepared pot and serve immediately with sliced apples and pears, roasted potatoes, chunks of fresh bread or whatever else you feel like dunking in a big vat of melted cheese.</li>
