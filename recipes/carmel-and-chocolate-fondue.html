        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p><em>Who knew you could fondue while camping? This sweet and salty dip is super easy to make. Just pack a saucepan, add the ingredients and stir over the fire until melted. Put your dippers in coffee cups and pass them around the fire.</em></p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <strong><ul>
            <li>Two 4-ounce good quality semi-sweet chocolate bars</li>
            <li>One 15.85-ounce jar prepared dulce de leche (about 1 1/3 cups)</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li> </strong>
            <li>Marshmallows, for dipping (optional)</li>
            <li>Graham crackers, for dipping (optional)</li>
            <li>Fresh fruit, such as berries, pineapple chunks and red and/or green grapes, for dipping (optional)</li> 
            <li>Cookies, shortbread or vanilla wafers, for dipping (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Build a medium-low campfire that has a grate for cooking. Break the chocolate bar into small pieces using the handle of a wooden spoon (or you can smack it against a picnic bench).</li><br>
            <li>Unwrap and add the pieces to a medium saucepan along with the dulce de leche, 1/2 cup and 1 teaspoon salt. </li><br>
            <li>Place the saucepan, on the grate and over the fire, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the chocolate melts and the sauce is completely smooth, about 5 minutes. If it?s too thick, then add 1 tablespoon of water at a time until desired consistency. Serve with suggested dippers, such as marshmallows, graham crackers, berries, pineapple chunks, red and/or green grapes, shortbread cookies or vanilla wafers.</li>
        </ol>
